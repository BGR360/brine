# brine

Brine is my attempt at writing a Minecraft client in Rust using the [Bevy game
engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

I don't recall what exactly gave me the idea for the name "brine." I think I was
thinking of Rust, then crustaceans, then the sea, and I landed on "brine." I
only later realized that it was short for
[Herobrine](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Herobrine) :-).
